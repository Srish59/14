A.Find the data distribution using box and scatter plot. 
Aim: To find the data distributions using box and scatter plot for a sample Data Frame.
Requirements: Python
Procedure:
In this program, we have a sample data frame called `data` with columns 'A', 'B', and 'C' to demonstrate the various plots.
Box Plot: We use `boxplot` function to create a box plot of the data.
Scatter Plot: We use `scatter` function to create a scatter plot between columns 'A' and 'B'. This `plt.title`, `plt.xlabel`, and `plt.ylabel` are used to set the titles and labels for the plots, and `plt.show` is used to display the plots.
Result: Hence, The Data Distribution is done using Box plot and scatter plots for sample Data frame. 

B.Find the outliers using Plot.
Aim: To Find outliers using plot for sample Data Frame.
Requirements: Python (Jupyter notebook)
Procedure:
In this program, we have a sample data frame called `data` with columns 'A', 'B', and 'C' to demonstrate the various plots.
-Outliers Plot: We use `boxplot` function to create a box plot specifically for column 'C' to identify any outliers.
`plt.title`, `plt.xlabel`, and `plt.ylabel` are used to set the titles and labels for the plots, and `plt.show` is used to display the plots.
Result: Hence, outliers are found using plot for sample Data frame.

C.Plot the Histogram,barchart and piechart on a sample data
Aim: To plot the Histogram, Barchart , Pie chart on sample data.
Requirements: Python (Jupyter notebook)
Procedure:
In this program, we have a sample data frame called `data` with columns 'A', 'B', and 'C' to demonstrate the various plots.
*Histogram: We use `hist` function to create a histogram for column 'A'.
*Bar Chart: We use `bar` function to create a bar chart between columns 'A' and 'B'.
*Pie Chart: We use `pie` function to create a pie chart with custom labels and sizes.
`plt.title`, `plt.xlabel`, and `plt.ylabel` are used to set the titles and labels for the plots, and `plt.show` is used to display the plots.
Result: Hence, The Histogram, Bar chart, Pie chart are drawn for sample Data Frame.
